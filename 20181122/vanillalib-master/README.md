# vanillalib
A compilation of vanilla made abstractions.

Most of them are Heavy compatible, meaning objects like [expr~] and [vline~] are replaced by alternatives.

Also, abstractions and variables are kept to minimum in order to copy and paste these abstractions as subpatches.

For example, you could copy and paste several instances of [rlpf~] into subpatches without needing to save it as an abstraction.
